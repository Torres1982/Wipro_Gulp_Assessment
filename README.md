# Wipro Gulp Assessment

###Technologies used:

1. Java Script
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. Pug
5. Gulp
6. npm/Node.js

###Assessment Description:

1. It's a simple assessment based on gulp concept that performs some tasks to optimize the project files:
- uglyfying/minifying (JS and CSS)
- concatenating (JS and CSS)
- converting Pug files to HTML files (used mixins and conditional statements).
- watching for JS and CSS files' changes with automatic live reloading/refreshing the web page once some changes has been made.
- compression of images.

2. UPDATES may apply - to be added soon:
- converting scss files to css files.
- find the solution for the bug with compression of *JPEG* files!

3. This exercise also implements a usage of Static Server that can be started with the Gulp tasks.

4. The assessment heavily relies on npm command-line commands which install dependencies (included in the package.jsoon file) and execute built tasks (worklflow of tasks defined in the gulpfile.js file).
